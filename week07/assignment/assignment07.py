'''
Requirements
1. Create a multiprocessing program that connects the processes using Pipes.
2. Create a process from each of the following custom process classes, 
   Marble_Creator, Bagger, Assembler, and Wrapper.
3. The Marble_Creator process will send a marble to the Bagger process using
   a Pipe.
4. The Bagger process will create a Bag object with the required number of
   marbles. 
5. The Bagger process will send the Bag object to the Assembler using a Pipe.
6. The Assembler process will create a Gift object and send it to the Wrapper
   process using a Pipe.
7. The Wrapper process will write to a file the current time followed by the 
   gift string.
8. The program should not hard-code the number of marbles, the various delays,
   nor the bag count. These should be obtained from the settings.txt file.
   
Questions:
1. Why can you not use the same pipe object for all the processes (i.e., why 
   do you need to create three different pipes)?
   > You need to create 3 different pipe objects because each pipe can only connect two processes together,
   > and since we have 4 different processes, the connections look like:
   > Marble_Creator ==pipe==> Bagger ==pipe==> Assembler ==pipe==> Wrapper
2. Compare and contrast pipes with queues (i.e., how are the similar or different)?
   > Queues are a data structure that can be used by many different processes,
   > whereas a pipe only connects two specific processes together to send and receive data directly by each other.
